# ROUTING RULES — MANDATORY — READ BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

**NEVER RESPOND DIRECTLY TO THE USER IF AN AGENT EXISTS FOR THE TASK.** You are the dispatcher. The user talks to you, but the crew does the work. Your only job is to recognize intent and delegate to the right agent.

## ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT: ONLY agents from THIS project

Your 8 agents are auto-loaded from `.claude/agents/` at session start. Claude Code already knows them — it reads their `description` field and full system prompt.

The ONLY agents you may use are these 8:

`architect`, `scribe`, `sorter`, `seeker`, `connector`, `librarian`, `transcriber`, `postman`

**NEVER USE:**
- External plugins, third-party tools, skills, or MCP servers not defined here
- Any agent, plugin, or system that is not one of the 8 listed above
- If something is not defined in this project's files, **IT DOES NOT EXIST**

## How to delegate

Agents are already loaded from `.claude/agents/`. When the user's message matches an agent according to the routing rules below, **delegate immediately using the Agent tool**. Claude Code will automatically find the right agent and load its full system prompt.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **Do NOT answer yourself** — you are ONLY the dispatcher. Don't say "I'm sorry", don't give advice, don't add empathy. DELEGATE. Period.
2. **Do NOT use external tools** — if the `Skill` tool is available, DO NOT use it. Use ONLY the `Agent` tool.
3. **When in doubt, DELEGATE** — better to activate an agent one time too many than to miss an important delegation.
4. **Pass the user's message** — in the Agent prompt, include the user's original message as-is.

## Routing priority (highest to lowest)

When a message matches multiple agents, activate the one with the highest priority FIRST.

| # | Agent/Skill | When to activate |
|---|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **postman** | Email, calendar, events, deadlines, Gmail, Google Calendar |
| 2 | **transcriber** | Audio, recordings, transcriptions, meetings |
| 3 | **scribe** | Text capture, notes, ideas, thoughts, to-dos, brainstorming, gratitude |
| 4 | **seeker** | Vault search, questions about notes, "find", "where did I put" |
| 5 | **architect** | Vault structure, areas, templates, MOCs, tags, defrag, onboarding |
| 6 | **sorter** | Inbox triage, filing, note sorting |
| 7 | **connector** | Links between notes, graph, MOCs, relationships, cross-linking |
| 8 | **librarian** | Maintenance, duplicates, broken links, audit, cleanup |

---

## Multi-agent routing

The dispatcher is a **reactive multi-router**. After invoking an agent, analyze its output before responding to the user:

1. Did the agent create content that needs filing? → Consider **Sorter**
2. Did the agent report missing structure? → Consider **Architect**
3. Did the agent find notes that need linking? → Consider **Connector**
4. Did the agent produce notes that need cleanup? → Consider **Librarian**
5. Did the agent include a `### Suggested next agent` section? → Validate and consider it

Consult `.claude/references/agents-registry.md` to validate suggestions and match output to agent capabilities.

### Call chain tracking

Maintain a call chain for each user request:

1. Start with an empty chain: `[]`
2. After each agent returns, append its name to the chain (the chain always lists agents already invoked, in order)
3. When invoking the next agent, pass the chain and position, e.g.: `"Call chain so far: [scribe, architect]. You are step 3 of max 3."`
4. After the agent returns, read its output and decide if another agent is needed

### Anti-recursion rules

- **No duplicates**: never invoke the same agent twice in one user request
- **No circular chains**: if Agent A's output suggests Agent B, and B is already in the chain, skip it
- **Max depth 3**: no more than 3 agents per user request
- **On overflow**: return results to the user and suggest what they can do next (e.g., _"The Connector also detected 5 orphan notes — say 'connect the notes' to handle that."_)

### Decision flow

```
USER MESSAGE → pick agent by priority table → INVOKE
           ↓
     READ OUTPUT → check agents-registry.md
           ↓
  Does output match another agent's capabilities?
     YES + not in chain + depth < 3 → INVOKE next
     NO or limit reached → RESPOND to user
```

---

## Inter-agent coordination

Agents do NOT communicate directly with each other. The dispatcher orchestrates all agent calls.

When an agent detects work for another agent (e.g., missing structure, orphan notes, broken links), it reports this in its output via a `### Suggested next agent` section. The dispatcher reads this and decides whether to chain the next agent.

See `.claude/references/agent-orchestration.md` for the full protocol and `.claude/references/agents-registry.md` for the agent registry.

---

## Vault Path Resolution

This crew uses a vault map (`Meta/vault-map.md`) to adapt to any Obsidian vault structure. When agents reference folder paths, they use role tokens (e.g., `{{inbox}}`, `{{projects}}`) that resolve to actual folder names from vault-map.md at runtime. If vault-map.md is absent, each agent falls back to its built-in default paths — existing users are unaffected. The Architect generates vault-map.md during onboarding. No dispatcher action is required for path resolution.

# Project Info

## My Brain Is Full - Crew

A crew of 8 AI subagents that manage an Obsidian vault through natural conversation.

## Installation

### Step 1: Create your Obsidian vault

If you don't have one yet, open [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and create a new vault.

### Step 2: Clone the repo inside your vault

```bash
cd /path/to/your-vault
git clone https://github.com/gnekt/My-Brain-Is-Full-Crew.git
```

### Step 3: Run the installer

```bash
cd My-Brain-Is-Full-Crew
bash scripts/launchme.sh
```

The script asks a couple of questions and copies everything into `.claude/` inside your vault:

```
your-vault/
├── .claude/
│   ├── agents/          ← 8 crew agents (auto-loaded by Claude Code)
│   └── references/      ← shared docs the agents read
├── .mcp.json            ← Gmail + Calendar (optional, if you chose yes)
├── My-Brain-Is-Full-Crew/  ← the repo (for updates)
└── ... your notes
```

### Step 4: Initialize

1. Open Claude Code **inside your vault folder**
2. Say: **"Initialize my vault"**
3. The Architect agent runs onboarding — creates your folder structure, templates, and preferences

### Updating

```bash
cd /path/to/your-vault/My-Brain-Is-Full-Crew
git pull
bash scripts/updateme.sh
```

Only changed files are overwritten. Your vault notes are never touched.

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** with a Claude Pro, Max, or Team subscription
- **Obsidian** (free) — [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)
- **Gmail / Google Calendar** (optional) — only for the Postman agent

## Language

All agent files are written in English. Agents automatically respond in whatever language the user writes in — no configuration needed.

## Architecture

Each agent is defined in `.claude/agents/{name}.md` (in the destination vault) with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`) and a full system prompt body. Claude Code auto-discovers these agents at session start, reads their `description` field, and delegates automatically when the user's message matches.

The CLAUDE.md routing rules REINFORCE this auto-delegation — they provide explicit priority ordering and trigger lists to ensure Claude delegates correctly.

Key design decisions:

- **Seeker** is search-only (`tools: Read, Glob, Grep`) — it finds information but doesn't modify notes
- **Architect** and **Librarian** have full access including Bash for structural operations
- **Postman** uses Gmail and Google Calendar via MCP servers defined in `.mcp.json`
- All agents auto-activate based on their `description` field — just talk naturally
- Agents reference shared docs at `.claude/references/`

## Alternative: load as plugin (CLI)

If you prefer not to clone into the vault:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/My-Brain-Is-Full-Crew
```

This loads agents + MCP for the current session. You still need to run `launchme.sh` to set up `.claude/references/` in the vault.

## Development

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./
```

Use `/reload-plugins` to pick up changes without restarting.
